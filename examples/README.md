# Thermistor Examples #

Two example uses for the thermistor class are included:

* **Simple Thermistor** shows how to connect and read a thermistor at a set interval, posting the values to Xively to produce a graph.
* **Battery Thermistor** shows how to produce the same results as the simple example, but while running on a battery. This example includes a few hardware changes to use energy more conscientiously.
